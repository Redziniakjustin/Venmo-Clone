## 💸 Summary
This Capstone simulates a program similar to Venmo, demonstrating basic concepts of a fullstack application. This project was a pair-programming project my partner and I had done during week 9 at Tech Elevator.

## 🥵 Challenges
In the beginning, communicating from our server to our client was a bit challenging but we took it one step at a time. We created test data that the client would send from forms and began building the pieces that we needed in order to save it to our database.

## 🐛 Known Bugs


## 🚀 Technologies Used
CLI and main application uses Java, while the databases (creating, reading, updating, and deleting) use PostgreSQL.
